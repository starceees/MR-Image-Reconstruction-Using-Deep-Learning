# MR-Image-Reconstruction-Using-Deep-Learning
This repository contains a modified U-Net architecture implementation specifically tailored for the reconstruction of MRI images. The U-Net model is a powerful convolutional neural network known for its efficiency in image segmentation tasks, and in this case, has been adapted to handle the complex data typically associated with MRI scans.
